> Psssst this is in the que to get rebuilt in react 


I must admit this is a old project but it's still worthy of a proper .MD


## My motivation?

Practice makes perfect! 
This was a great final project to end my first ever JS boot-camp.
I'm writing this README.md years after finishing the project but it's great looking back at
how far I've came and what I've accomplished. 


How great was it to practice everything learned in my course all in one project! 
You can tell how good the course was by the level of the project, not bad huh.
 

I had so much fun coding this and showing it all to my peers in the boot camp.


## Why I built this project?
To test the waters with API's and how to use them and I picked my favorite sites of all to practice with

Using YouTube API as my finial project gave me an incredible amount of motivation, since this 
is one of my favorite apps to use. So creating a app, that in my opinion helps the viewing experience 

This was a great project to practice using API's and a final project for a JS boot-camp.
What better way to practice using Vanilla JS than with your favorite apps API. 
This made all the nights of working and hurdles easier when you are in love with the App already.

## What problem does it solve?
This app eliminates having a scrunched screen when having one monitor and having 2 windows open.

The app allows for a full screen uninterrupted viewing, meaning no black constraining bars on the left of right side or added UI elements below. A 100% screen to screen viewing experience from mobile to as large as your browser window allows. 

You are able to scroll horizontally through not only your subscriptions but your videos loaded. 
This makes for easy browsing when multi-tasking.
