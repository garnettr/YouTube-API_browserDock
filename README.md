> Psssst this is in the que to get rebuilt in react 


> This was a great final project to end my first ever JS boot-camp.
I'm writing this README.md years after finishing the project and it's great looking back at
how far I've came and what I've accomplished. 


## My motivation?

To practice, practice, practice! 

My goal was to learn how to use client side API's and how to work with JSON data.
I knew once I was able to access the data that the sky was the limit with what I could build. 

developer.google.com provides great documentation on how to get started with YouTubes API.
This was a great starting place for everything I needed to get started and through roadblocks.


## Why I built this project?

I wanted to build a great app, that I could use everday. Something that would keep me coming back to it.
Not just a app to test out a new coding pattern and then it's discarded. 

But rather and app that was built around something I already had an interest in. 



## What problem does it solve?

This app eliminates having a scrunched screen when using one monitor and having 2 windows open.

It also allows for a full screen uninterrupted viewing, meaning no black constraining bars on the left of right side or added UI elements below. A 100% screen to screen viewing experience from mobile to as large as your browser window allows.
